Twitter Rumor Detector
======================

Overview
--------

Twitter Rumor Detector is a Java web application built using Java Spark framework and that has three primary academic goals:

1.  Try to apply several data mining techniques such as vector space retrieval, web crawling or extraction of keywords for retrieving rumors in Twitter.

2.  Try to give an approach of how applying information retrieval in massive social networks to obtain meaningful data.

3.  Get in contact with tools of machine learning and NPL that are useful for the development of data mining applications.
